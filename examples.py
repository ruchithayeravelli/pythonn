# 1)Given the total seconds, compute and print equivalent hours, minutes, and seconds using arithmetic operations.

# 2)Assign the price and quantity of two products. Calculate the total cost including 18% tax. Print a detailed bill?

# 5) What is a compiled language? What is an interpreted language?
#    Explain pros and cons of each. How hybrid languages bring in advantages of both.
#  PVM and JVM (Super Simple Explanation)
# PVM = Python Virtual Machine
# ðŸ‘‰ It runs Python bytecode.
# ðŸ‘‰ Example: When you run a Python program, PVM executes it and shows output.

# JVM = Java Virtual Machine
# ðŸ‘‰ It runs Java bytecode.
# ðŸ‘‰ Example: When you run a Java program, JVM executes it and shows output.

# âœ… Think Like This
# ðŸ”¹ Python Program â†’ compiled to .pyc â†’ PVM runs it
# ðŸ”¹ Java Program â†’ compiled to .class â†’ JVM runs it
